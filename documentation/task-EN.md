Students are asked to complete a project to create a "personal assistant" with a command line interface.


## The "personal assistant" should be able to:
+ store contacts with names, birthdays, phone numbers, emails, and sort tags in a contact book;
- display a list of contacts whose birthday is in a specified number of days from the current date;
+ check the correctness of the entered phone number and email when creating or editing an entry and notify the user in case of incorrect entry;
+ search for contacts among the contacts in the book;
+ edit and delete entries from the contact book;
+ store notes with text information;
+ search by notes;
+ edit and delete notes;
+ add "tags" to notes, keywords that describe the topic and subject of the note;
+ search and sort notes by keywords (tags);
- sort files in the specified folder by category (images, documents, videos, etc.).

+ An additional complicated task: The bot should analyze the entered text and try to guess what the user wants from it and offer the closest command to execute


## Eligibility criteria:
+ the project must be saved in a separate repository and be publicly available (GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket);
+ the project contains detailed instructions for installation and use;
* the project is installed as a Python package and can be called anywhere in the system by the appropriate command after installation;
+ the project fully implements at least 8 requirements out of 12 described in the assignment;
+ The personal assistant saves information on the hard disk in the user's folder and can be restarted without losing data.

P.S.: You don't have to implement all the requirements from the assignment, but only the minimum required. You can also expand/change the functionality of the project at your discretion, but be sure to consult with your mentor before doing so. Consider this project as part of your portfolio and a useful tool. For this reason, the initiative to expand and supplement the requirements for the project is welcome.
